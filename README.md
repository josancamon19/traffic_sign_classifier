## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program
Overview
---
In this project, you will use what you've learned about deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks to classify traffic signs. You will train and validate a model so it can classify traffic sign images using the [German Traffic Sign Dataset](http://benchmark.ini.rub.de/?section=gtsrb&subsection=dataset). After the model is trained, you will then try out your model on images of German traffic signs that you find on the web.

To meet specifications, the project will require submitting three files: 
* the Ipython notebook with the code
* the code exported as an html file
* a writeup report either as a markdown or pdf file

The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report

### Dataset and Repository

2. Clone the project, which contains the Ipython notebook and the writeup template.
```sh
git clone https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project

### Data Set Summary & Exploration

#### 1. Provide a basic summary of the data set. In the code, the analysis should be done using python, numpy and/or pandas methods rather than hardcoding results manually.

I used the pandas library to calculate summary statistics of the traffic
signs data set:

* The size of training set is 34799
* The size of the validation set is 4410
* The size of test set is 12630
* The shape of a traffic sign image is (32,32,3)
* The number of unique classes/labels in the data set is 43

#### 2. Include an exploratory visualization of the dataset.

Here is an exploratory visualization of the data set. It is a bar chart showing how the data ...

### Design and Test a Model Architecture

#### 1. Describe how you preprocessed the image data. What techniques were chosen and why did you choose these techniques? Consider including images showing the output of each preprocessing technique. Pre-processing refers to techniques such as converting to grayscale, normalization, etc. (OPTIONAL: As described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric, if you generated additional data for training, describe why you decided to generate additional data, how you generated the data, and provide example images of the additional data. Then describe the characteristics of the augmented training set like number of images in the set, number of images for each class, etc.)

As a first step, I decided to convert the images to grayscale because ...

Here is an example of a traffic sign image before and after grayscaling.

As a last step, I normalized the image data because ...

I decided to generate additional data because ... 

To add more data to the the data set, I used the following techniques because ... 

Here is an example of an original image and an augmented image:

The difference between the original data set and the augmented data set is the following ... 


#### 2. Describe what your final model architecture looks like including model type, layers, layer sizes, connectivity, etc.) Consider including a diagram and/or table describing the final model.

My final model consisted of the following layers:

| Layer         		|     Description	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Input         		| 32x32x3 RGB image   							| 
| Convolution 5x5     	| 1x1 stride, 'VALID' padding, outputs 28x28x16	|
| RELU					|												|
| Max pooling	      	| 2x2 stride,  outputs 14x14x16 				|
| Convolution 5x5     	| 1x1 stride, 'VALID' padding, outputs 10x10x32	|
| RELU					|												|
| Max pooling	      	| 2x2 stride,  outputs 5x5x32 				|
| Flatten    |  output shape: batch_size x 800     									|
| Fully connected		| 800 x 512 shape        									|
| RELU					|												|
| Fully connected		| 512 x 128 shape        									|
| RELU					|												|
| Fully connected		| 128 x 43 shape        									|
|						|												|
 


#### 3. Describe how you trained your model. The discussion can include the type of optimizer, the batch size, number of epochs and any hyperparameters such as learning rate.

To train the model, I used an ....

#### 4. Describe the approach taken for finding a solution and getting the validation set accuracy to be at least 0.93. Include in the discussion the results on the training, validation and test sets and where in the code these were calculated. Your approach may have been an iterative process, in which case, outline the steps you took to get to the final solution and why you chose those steps. Perhaps your solution involved an already well known implementation or architecture. In this case, discuss why you think the architecture is suitable for the current problem.

My final model results were:
* validation set accuracy of 0.950
* test set accuracy of 0.932

If an iterative approach was chosen:

The first architecture I tried was LeNet, just changing the input and output size and processing the images to grayscale, I chose it just for test but the results was no great, then I tried adding more conv layers, tried reducing fc layers and even adding batchnorm layers (was so weird don't see any improvement with those) but the results was worse than the first one, finally I decided to tune the initial LeNet, adding, reducing the number of nodes in each layer in order to be able to catch more in each image, changing the depth and in this way was how I finally found a decent model. 

If a well known architecture was chosen:
* What architecture was chosen?
* Why did you believe it would be relevant to the traffic sign application?
* How does the final model's accuracy on the training, validation and test set provide evidence that the model is working well?
 
### Test a Model on New Images

#### 1. Choose five German traffic signs found on the web and provide them in the report. For each image, discuss what quality or qualities might be difficult to classify.

Here are five German traffic signs that I found on the web:

![alt text][image4] ![alt text][image5] ![alt text][image6] 
![alt text][image7] ![alt text][image8]

Some images might was difficult to classify due to the quality of the photos but essentially due to the missing of image augmentation, like scale resize rotate and so on, techniques very very useful. 

Obviously, in a real approach image augmentation is essential.

#### 2. Discuss the model's predictions on these new traffic signs and compare the results to predicting on the test set. At a minimum, discuss what the predictions were, the accuracy on these new predictions, and compare the accuracy to the accuracy on the test set (OPTIONAL: Discuss the results in more detail as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric).

Here are the results of the prediction:

| Image			        |     Prediction	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| Stop Sign      		| Stop sign   									| 
| Priority Road     			| Priority Road 									|
| No Entry					| No Entry											|
| Traffic Signals      		| Traffic Signals					 				|
| General Caution			| General Caution      							|


The model was able to correctly guess 9 of the 11 traffic signs, which gives an accuracy of 82%. This seems not favorably relating to the accuracy on the test set of 93.2%

#### 3. Describe how certain the model is when predicting on each of the five new images by looking at the softmax probabilities for each prediction. Provide the top 5 softmax probabilities for each image along with the sign type of each probability. (OPTIONAL: as described in the "Stand Out Suggestions" part of the rubric, visualizations can also be provided such as bar charts)

For the first image, the model is pretty sure that this is a stop sign (probability of 0.99961), and the image does contain a stop sign. The top five soft max probabilities were

| Probability         	|     Prediction	        					| 
|:---------------------:|:---------------------------------------------:| 
| .99961         			| Stop sign   									| 
| .0002     				| Yield										|
| .0000x					| Speed limit (30 km/h)											|
| .0000x	      			| Speed limit (60 km/h)				 				|
| .0000x				    | Bycicles crossing     							|
